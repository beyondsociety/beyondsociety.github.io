Finally got around to setting up a repository on github for my operating system called ibox. Started cleaning up code and setting up documentation, todo list, and loging code issues. I decided I wanted to switch over to using clang instead of a cross-compiled gcc and ran into a few problems. After trying to debug and posting help on osdev.org, I figured out what the issue was. It was an issue with clang using the host tools to compile and bringing in all sorts of extra libraries. A cross-compiled gcc is so much easier to get code to compile since you dont have most host toolchain problems. So in retrospect, I was literally banging my head against the desk trying to get my code to compile with clang, if only they had better documentation. I plan to work on my os weekly and add new code features and clean up older code. 

Ive also been working on 2 other projects as well when Ive had time. One is using the raspberry pi as a hardware device and other other is weather monitoring software. Ive been able to get the rpi to load a custom logo and compile mono .net programs on it. Ive also been able to get the rpi to load my own program created in C# .net and gtk onto the screen. Next I plan to get the rpi to autoboot my program as well as start working on the actual interface and underlying code for it. Ive been mostly just trying to figure out how everything works, once I get that all sorted out, I plan to dive heavily into coding it.
