Welcome to my personal blog, I decided to create this blog to showcase my various computer and programming projects and as a means to jot down ideas and things I find interesting. At the moment I am working on my own operating system and bootloaders to go along with this project which you can check out at [Ibox](http://bitbucket.org/beyondsociety). I also have two new projects, one using the raspberry pi as a custom hardware device and the other one, weather monitoring software written in C# and WPF .net framework. 

These two projects are still in the early stages of development, but when more stuff comes along I'll let you know about it. I also just joined github and plan on moving most of my projects over from bitbucket and sourceforge and hopefully start contributing more to other projects as I gain more experience. 

This blog is hosted on github pages using jeykll software with the Poole/Layon Theme. You can find out more about Jeykll by [visiting the project on GitHub](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and the [Poole/Lanyon] (http://github.com/poole/lanyon) based theme.
